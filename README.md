(1) Understand assembly basics                                                   
(2) To present the futuristic ideas Zero Marginal Cost Society by Jeremy Rifkins.  

In the Zero Marginal Cost Society, the intense competition forces even-leaner technology, boosting productivity to the optimum point in which cost of producing each additional unit (if fixed costs are not counted) becomes essentially zero making the product nearly free; causing capitalism to end. This will cause technological unemployment: unemployment due to our discovery of means of economizing the use of labor outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labor. The Internet of Things will connect everything with everyone in an integrated global network. People, machines, natural resources, production lines, logistics networks, consumption habits, recycling flows, and virtually every other aspect of economic and social life will be linked via sensors and software to the IoT platform, continually feeding Big Data to every node—businesses,homes, vehicles—moment to moment, in real time.
